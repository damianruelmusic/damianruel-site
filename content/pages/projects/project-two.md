**(UPCOMING)**

A new double single in the works about growing up!

**(RELEASED)**

**(to your left)**

This song represents a feeling I've never felt before. The lyrics mean things that only 2 people in the world will understand. So do the chords. Many quick key changes to represent a quick series of new feelings, focusing around Eb major (the key that represents love), and B major (one of the most important keys to me)

**(iv (redux))**

1.  (revisited) iv:
    I revisited an old work to change the arrangement a little bit and the harmony. It matches the feeling the song represents better.


2.  (remix) iv:
    A sampled and remixed version to represent that I am a new person and different from when I first wrote the song.

**(silly titles dont mean satire)**

1.  words:
    Overlapping vocals.

    2nd verse, all lines end in "you". Last line "this word repeats in my head, this word is 'you'" explains that.

    "You" just keep showing up in my thoughts.

2.  i write a lot of music at night:
    Someone's story. Written in the middle of the night.
    i thought it'd be funny to have that intro lol

3.  i like to overreact:
    A poem originally.

    When I overwork myself, my vision feels like it goes away and my blood feels stale. I just tell myself I'm overreacting.

    "death, come upon me death, come upon me death come upon me."
    I recorded it in one take for authenticity's sake

4.  Track 4 title:
    something i chose to end. left in time as a work in progress

5.  Archive No. 2 :
    The second work in my Archive series. Jazz. Harmonic experiment. Melodic experiment. Crazy setup for chromatic bass walk.

6.  if i could, i would have named this one just a space or something so it could be invisible:

    Wind ensemble piece. Displays some of my understanding of harmony. My love for music goes beyond the indie canon. Spent the most time on this out of everything else in the EP.

**(Archive No. 1)**

The first time I wanted to really practice with how notes behave.

**(iv)**

Me practicing writing in Spanish. I didn't really speak it at home so I learned at school and by writing in it. 4 is a number that was formative in my life. I also practiced with meter changes.

**(Dejarte)**

My first song, written in somebody else's perspective. I hope they never find out.
