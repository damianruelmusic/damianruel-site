**(UPCOMING)**

A new double single in the works about growing up!

**(RELEASED)**

**(to your left)**

**(iv (redux))**

**(silly titles dont mean satire)**

1.  words: 
    Overlapping vocals.

    2nd verse, all lines end in "you". Last line "this word repeats in my head, this word is 'you'" explains that.

    "You" just keep showing up in my thoughts.


2.  i write a lot of music at night: 
    Someone's story. Written in the middle of the night.
    i thought it'd be funny to have that intro lol


3.  i like to overreact:
    A poem originally.

    When I overwork myself, my vision feels like it goes away and my blood feels stale. I just tell myself I'm overreacting.

    "death, come upon me death, come upon me death come upon me."
    I recorded it in one take for authenticity's sake


4.  Track 4 title:
    something i chose to end. left in time as a work in progress


5.  Archive No. 2 :
    The second work in my Archive series. Jazz. Harmonic experiment. Melodic experiment. Crazy setup for chromatic bass walk.


6.  if i could, i would have named this one just a space or something so it could be invisible:

    Wind ensemble piece. Displays some of my understanding of harmony. My love for music goes beyond the indie canon. Spent the most time on this out of everything else in the EP.

**(Archive No. 1)**
