        name: >-
          Damian, known professionally as damianruel, is a Chicago-based
          multi-instrumentalist, composer, and otherwise artist whose work
          reflects partly his self-taught findings from exploring how notes work
          with his many curious ideas. He is his own producer and he plays the
          instruments in his song to ensure it ends up how he envisions it.
        title: >-
          He keeps a genre-fluid approach to his projects, and likes to think he
          is unrestricted in musical expression. While his projects don't stick
          to one or three genres, he has a very unique vibe in the music he
          creates. He is very intentional with what he puts out, sometimes
          because he thinks it's funny to have an intro that's unrelated to the
          song, or if he thinks a note should be a quarter-tone sharp to bring
          out a certain feeling in the phrase.
